This is a markdown file that provides brief background information and guidance, along with links to markdown files (which can also link to external sites) providing more detailed information. This can be used, for instance, in order to provide information necessary for coders to use a library, or as part of research to learn about a person or organization and so forth. You are free to use the llms.txt logo on your site to indicate your support if you wish. llms.txt markdown is human and LLM readable, but is also in a precise format allowing fixed processing methods (i.e. classical programming techniques such as parsers and regex). For instance, there is an llms-txt project providing a CLI and Python module for parsing llms.txt files and generating LLM context from them.""",
